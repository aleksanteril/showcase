# Valio Aimo Zero-Fail

## Overview

In essence, we have a prediction model for a wholesales warehouse stock designed to trigger an ElevenLabs Call Agent AI.
We have 2 agents, one is on the website as a chatbot agent, designed to help substitutions with the customer via chat for risky items that could run out before the expected deliver.
The second agent is a Call Agent AI that would contact the customers in urgent situations, to arrange last minute substitutions to avoid delivery failures.

## Key Features

- Feature 1: Prediction model to trigger Call Agent AI
- Feature 2: Website Chatbot AI to assist customers.

## How It Works

The prediction model fell kinda short, and we only got the Frontend working with the AI Agents.
The demo of the Call Agent API is on the website, because of implementation reasons. We wanted to use something so we could actually call phones Twigli for example.

## Technologies Used

- ElevenLabs API, AI Agents
- Vite + React
- Figma + AI,

## Getting Started

```bash
Check out the website.
```

## Future Plans

To improve the prediction model and actually combine all of the components together into a unified product. 
And actually have the Call Agent AI call to a phone via the correct things.
